Lifting weights and building AI models may seem like two completely different activities, but they actually share several important principles. Whether you're trying to push a new personal best at the gym or fine-tuning a machine learning algorithm, the process of incremental improvement, discipline, and learning from failure is strikingly similar.

## 1. The Importance of a Strong Foundation

When I first started benching, I didn’t begin with heavy weights. I focused on form, stability, and foundational strength. This mirrors the way we approach AI development. Before jumping into complex models, we need to understand the fundamentals: data quality, feature selection, and simple algorithms. Both in the gym and in AI, building a strong foundation sets you up for long-term success.

## 2. Progress is Slow but Steady

In weightlifting, progress doesn't happen overnight. Adding 5 kg to your bench press might take weeks of consistent effort. The same applies to AI. Models improve over time, through countless iterations and small tweaks to hyperparameters. Success isn’t about rapid gains but about patience and persistence.

## 3. Fail Fast, Learn Faster

In the gym, you sometimes miss a lift. It’s frustrating, but it’s part of the process. In AI, failures—whether in training models, tuning hyperparameters, or dealing with bad data—are inevitable. The key is to fail fast, understand what went wrong, and learn from it. Each failure is a step closer to success.

## 4. Technique Over Power

Just like proper form is crucial for safely lifting heavier weights, having a clear strategy and technique is essential in AI. Throwing more data or more compute at a problem without a proper understanding can lead to inefficiencies. In both fields, mastering technique can outperform raw power.

## 5. Rest and Reflection Matter

Lifting weights every day without giving your body time to recover can lead to injury. Similarly, when developing AI systems, taking time to step back, reflect on your progress, and let new ideas simmer is critical. Breaks lead to breakthroughs, whether you're building muscle or building models.

## Conclusion

Most people didn't actually read this, cause neither have I.

_This is obviously a sarcastic take on Linkedin._
